Here's a YAML file defining the Android language for TabNine:
Android:
  type: programming
  color: "#3DDC84"
  extensions:
    - .java
    - .kt
    - .xml
  filenames:
    - AndroidManifest.xml
    - build.gradle
    - proguard-rules.pro
  ace_mode: java
  codemirror_mode: clike
  codemirror_mime_type: text/x-java
  tm_scope: source.java
  language_id: 1000
  aliases:
    - android-sdk
  interpreters:
    - dalvikvm
  group: Java
This definition includes:
1.
The language name: Android
2.
Type: programming
3.
Color: Android green (#3DDC84)
4.
Common file extensions: .java, .kt (Kotlin), .xml
5.

6.
Editor modes for syntax highlighting
7.
Language ID (arbitrarily set to 1000)
8.

9.

This should provide a good starting point for TabNine to recognize and work with Android-specific files and code. You may want to adjust or expand this definition based on specific needs or 
additional Android-related file types.
